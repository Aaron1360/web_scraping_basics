Web Scraping and Data Processing Repository

This repository is a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate fundamental web scraping techniques and how to process the scraped data effectively. 


The content here serves as a starting point for:

- **Web Scraping**: You will find scripts that demonstrate web scraping using popular Python libraries like `requests` and `Beautiful Soup`. These scripts show you how to retrieve web content and parse it to extract the data you need.

- **Data Processing**: Once you've scraped data, it's important to process and store it efficiently. This repository provides examples of working with different data formats, including PDF, CSV, Excel, and text files. You'll learn how to clean and structure the data to make it useful.


Please feel free to contribute or open issues if you have questions, encounter problems, or want to add new features or examples.
